# HyGen
Construction of cheap hydrogen generator using GT-A060 PEM electrolytic cell.

## Material needed 
- GT-A060 PEM electrolytic cell (AliExpress around $35)
- 300W 20A DC-DC Buck Converter Step Down Module Constant Current (AliExpress around $5)
- Digital Voltmeter DC 100V 10A Voltmeter Ammeter Blue + Red LED (AliExpress around @3)
- Power supply with voltage 5 to 30 V and power around 50 W (I use 19 V supply from old notebook)
- 6 mm (1/4") tubes 3 - 4 meters 
- 8 mm (1/3") aluminium rod or tube 55 cm long
- printed parts
- 0.5 l Coca-Cola bottle
- PET bottle preforms (40ml Plastic Test Tubes with Metal Screw Cap on AliExpress) - 2 PCs
- Reusable Silica Gel desiccant (ideal is the blue type which changes color when moistened) 
- piece of nylon stocking or similar fabric and two small elastic bands or pieces of wire
- screws M3/20mm 4 PCs with brass heatstake inserts, screws M3/12mm with nuts 2 PCs, screws M5/15mm 2 PCs

## Printed parts
- stand with holders for PEM cell, converter, and voltmeter/ammeter
- bottle cap - 4 tubes for water container from a Coca-Cola bottle
- bottle cap - 3 tubes for hydrogen/water separator
- bottle cap - 2 tubes for silica gel desiccator

## Workflow
- 3D print the parts (don't forget to add supports to the 4 bottom holes on the stand in slicer)
- seal inserts to the bottle caps and rod holder on the stand and insert M3 srews
- thread the tubes through the holes in the caps according to the diagram (I found it helpful to cut the tubes diagonally first to make them easier to insert into the holes)
- attach strainers made from pieces of nylon stockings to the ends of the tubes in the desiccator using rubber bands or wire to prevent the silica gel from falling into the tubes
- attach the PEM cell and converter to the stand using the screws
- connect the electric circuit according to the diagram
- insert the correct ends of the tubes into the quick connectors on the PEM cell according to the diagram
- fill the desiccator bottle with silica gel (the longer tube must be first inserted deep into bottle)
